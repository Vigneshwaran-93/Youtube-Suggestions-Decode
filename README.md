# Youtube-Suggestions-Decode
Decoding Youtube Recommendations!
## Work in Progress 
YouTube Sidebar Suggestions Decoder is a tool designed to fetch and analyze the video suggestions that appear in the sidebar when watching a video on YouTube. These recommendations are part of YouTube's algorithm, which suggests other videos based on the one being viewed. This project allows users to retrieve, decode, and analyze those suggestions programmatically.
With this tool, you can explore the logic behind YouTubeâ€™s sidebar recommendations, understand which videos are being suggested based on a specific video, and study the patterns in those suggestions.
